# CASLib
Simple Computer Algebra System

# Why produce this when there are competitors such as SymPy or Maple?
This project is produced to help understand the internals of a CAS system through simple techniques
such as string manipulation and OOP which can be used to manipulate single mathematical terms. The
system is also designed to help provide any computational analysis required in the course I am
currently studying for.

# Future of the project

- Fully functional Calculus (limits, differentials, gradients, divergence, infinite series).
- Plotting functionality (graphs & 3d graphs)
- Compatiability with simple Maple commands such as int and diff.
